 * QKeySequence has been recorded and gotKeySequence is emitted. See multiKeyShortcutsAllowed and
 * modifierlessAllowed for what constitutes a valid key sequence.
 *
 * During recording any shortcuts are inhibited and cannot be triggered. Either by using the

 * keyboard-shortcuts-inhibit protocol </a> on Wayland or grabbing the keyboard.
 *
 * For graphical elements that record key sequences and can optionally perform conflict checking
 * against existing shortcuts see KKeySequenceWidget and KeySequenceItem.
 *
 * Porting from KF5 to KF6:
 *
 * The class KeySequenceRecorder was renamed to KKeySequenceRecorder.
