    \title KGuiAddons

    KGuiAddons are addons to QtGui. They provide utilities for graphical user interfaces in the areas
    of colors, fonts, text, images, and keyboard input.

    \section1 Color utilities

    The KColorUtils namespace contains various small utilities to work with colors. KColorCollection provides
    handling of color collections ("pallettes"). KColorMimeData adds drag-and-drop and clipboard mimedata
    manipulation to QColor objects

    \section1 Text utilities

    KWordWrap is a special word wrapping algorithm that takes beauty into account. It can be used
    directly with QPainter or can return the wrapped text in a QString.

    KDateValidator is a QValidator that validates user-entered dates.

    KFontUtils::adaptFontSize() is a function that calculates the biggest font size (in points)
    that can be used to draw a text centered in a rectangle using word wrapping.

    \section1 Keyboard utilities

    KKeySequenceRecorder is a utility that records a QKeySequence by listening to key events in a window.
    This can be used to let the user modify predefined keyboard shortcuts for example.

    \section1 Icon utilities

    KIconUtils contains functions to add overlays on top of a QIcon.

    \section1 Cursor utilities

    KCursorSaver is used to temporarily set a mouse cursor and restore the previous one on destruction.
